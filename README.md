# Optimized-IoT-Intrusion-Classification-using-PCA-LDA
This project addresses the challenges of high-dimensional IoT traffic data for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Using the IoTID20 dataset, it explores dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, LDA, and hybrid PCA+LDA) to improve classification accuracy while reducing computational cost for real-world IoT deployment.
