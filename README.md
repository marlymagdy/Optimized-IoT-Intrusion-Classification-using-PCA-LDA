# Optimized-IoT-Intrusion-Classification-using-PCA-LDA

## üìå Introduction
This project addresses the challenges of high-dimensional IoT traffic data for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Using the IoTID20 dataset, it explores dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, LDA, and hybrid PCA+LDA) to improve classification accuracy while reducing computational cost for real-world IoT deployment.

## 0Ô∏è‚É£|1Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Classification Results

**Model Explanations:**

- **Label LDA Feature** ‚Üí Uses only the binary label (Normal/Malicious) as a discriminator. Simplest reduction, but loses finer details.  
- **Category LDA Features** ‚Üí Groups attacks into broader categories (e.g., DoS, Probe). Captures more structure than Label-based.  
- **Subcategory LDA Features** ‚Üí Uses detailed subcategories of attacks, giving more discriminative power.  
- **PCA + LDA (Category/Subcategory)** ‚Üí First reduces dimensionality with PCA, then applies LDA. Helps balance speed and accuracy.  

**Model Performance Comparison (Binary Classification):**

‚úÖ **Best Models (Binary):**  
- **30 PCA + LDA (Subcategory)** ‚Üí Highest accuracy (**99.99%**)  
- **Subcategory LDA Features** ‚Üí Best trade-off between accuracy and speed (fit: 998 ms, predict: 3 ms)

## üî¢ Multi-Class Classification Results

**Model Explanations:**

- **Category LDA components** ‚Üí Projects data into fewer dimensions based on attack categories (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L).  
- **Subcategory LDA components** ‚Üí Uses finer-grained attack subcategories, improving separability between different attack types.  
- **PCA + LDA (Category/Subcategory)** ‚Üí Combines PCA (to reduce redundancy) and LDA (to enhance class separation).  
- **Category LDA + Cross Validation** ‚Üí Validates generalization performance across multiple folds, more robust but slower.  

**Model Performance Comparison (Multi-Class Classification):**

‚úÖ **Best Models (Multi-Class):**  
- **Subcategory LDA components** ‚Üí Best overall F1-score (**0.996**) with efficient training.  
- **Category LDA + Cross Validation** ‚Üí Excellent recall, but computationally expensive.
